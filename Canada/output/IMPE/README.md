### IMPE model, Error measures for daily deaths 

<br/><br/>

**Calculate the error measures:**

Reference = JOHN, Model = IMPE 

.

(1) **Error** = Reference minus Model 

(Graph 3 under each location, except provinces together, shows the Error by all calendar days and all updates)

.

(2) **Absolute Error** = | Reference minus Model | 

(Graph 4 under each location, except provinces together, shows the Absolute Error by all calendar days and all updates)

.

(3) **Percent Error** = 100 * (Reference minus Model) / Reference

(Graph 5 under each location, except provinces together, shows the Percent Error by all calendar days and all updates)

.

(4) **Absolute Percent Error** = 100 * | Reference minus Model | / Reference

(Graph 6 under each location, except provinces together, shows the Absolute Percent Error by all calendar days and all updates)


<br/><br/>

**Summarize the error measures:**

First by epidemiological (epi) weeks and updates, then by epi weeks only (get rid of updates), and finally by model-location only (get rid of epi weeks).

<br/><br/>


(1) Get the MEDIAN of error types by epi weeks and updates

Summarization level = calendar time in days: transform calendar days to epidemiological weeks (623 days to 89 weeks = 7 to 1)

(Graphs not shown here to save space)

.

(2) Get the AVERAGE over updates of MEDIAN of error types by epi weeks

Summarization level = updates: transform many updates to one update 92 updates to 1 update-free)

Graphs 7 to 10 under each location (except provinces together) (shown below) show the four types of error by epi weeks (update-free)

.

(3) Get the AVERAGE over epi weeks of the above number (2)

Summarization level = calendar time in epi weeks: transform many epi weeks to a single statistic (89 week to 1 model-location)

(Graphs shown under "Canada provinces together")
