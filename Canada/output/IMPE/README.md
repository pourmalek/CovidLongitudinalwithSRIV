### IMPE model, Error measures for daily deaths 

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

**Calculate the error measures:**

Reference = JOHN, Model = DELP

(1) Error = Reference minus Model 

(2) Absolute Error = | Reference minus Model |

(3) Percent Error = 100 * (Reference minus Model) / Reference

(4) Absolute Percent Error = 100 * | Reference minus Model | / Reference


<br/><br/>

**Summarize the error measures:**

(1) get the MEDIAN of error types by epi weeks and updates

summarization level = calendar time in days: transform calendar days to epidemiological weeks (623 to 89 = 7 to 1)

(graphs not shown here to save space)



(2) get the AVERAGE over updates of MEDIAN of error types by epi weeks

summarization level = updates: transform many updates to one update (142 to 1)

the last graphs under each location (shown below) for Mean over updates of: **Median Absolute Percent Error** by epi weeks



(3) get the AVERAGE over epi weeks of the above number (2)

summarization level = calendar time in epi weeks: transform many epi weeks to a single statistic (89 to 1)
