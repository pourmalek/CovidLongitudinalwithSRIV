# CovidLongitudinal
Longitudinal assessment of COVID-19 models

**Compare predictions of periodically updated international COVID-19 pandemic models with official reports of the countries to the World Health Organization.** 

Deaths predicted by the models are compared with deaths officially reported.

Cases predicted by the models are compared with cases officially reported. 

Infections predicted by IHME and IMPE do not have "reported" counterparts.
