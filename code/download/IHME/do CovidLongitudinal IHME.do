/*
Explanation of "linkdate", "download", and "urldate":

"linkdate" is the date of update as shown on web page https://www.healthdata.org/node/8787 titled "COVID-19 estimate downloads | Archive", that mentions "Archive dates correspond to the update in the projections tool with most recent data, which may differ from the date listed on the downloaded file." 

"linkdate" is the "update date" here.

"download" is the name of the directory that is created after downloading the files and unzipped. Later updates do not create a directory and the files get downloaded directly to the root of -present working directory- that is /IHME/.

"download" is used here with command -cd- to change directory to the created directory (and later, -cd ..- is used to come back to the root /IHME/.

"urldate" is the date mentioned in the URL of the update.

"urldate" is used in the download URL here.

/*

A tiny defect in IHME update 2021-01-28:

The original variable "deaths_mean_smoothed" is blank for "date" 2021-01-23, 2021-01-24, and
2021-01-25 in 69 location-dates. 

One way forward is to assume it is logical and safe to replace those blank values
with correspondent values of the original variable "deaths_mean" (that is not smoothed).
